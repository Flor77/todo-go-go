TODO app with React for frontend and Firebase for backend. The user can add a to do by filling a form (Controlled component) that has an input for the todo text, an input for date and time (date and time pickers from MUI), and select the project to add the todo. Filter the todos by date (Today, Next 7 days, All days) or by project, when clicks on project, only the todos under that project will appear. The user can add, remove or edit a todo. When editing a todo the user won't need to hit a "save button" to save the changes the changes will be saved automatically. The user can add, remove, rename a project. When removing a project, all the todos under that project will be removed. When the user completes a todo, it shows a line through the text of the todo and show a Circle Check Icon instead of a Circle (from react bootstrap icons). When a todo is completed, the user can repeat the todo next day.
